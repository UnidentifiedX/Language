## Language
Open-source, extremely verbose interpreted language written in C#. Its main objective is to make an easily readable programming language that is grammatically correct in English.

## Features
- [x] Binary operators (+, -, /, *, %, &&, || >, >=, <, <=)
- [x] Binary bitwise operators (&, |, ^)
- [x] Unary operators (-, +)
- [x] Unary bitwise operators (~)
- [x] Variable assignment (bool and int)
- [ ] More variable types (float, double, ~~strings~~)
- [x] If and switch statements, while and for loops
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Classes

## TODO
- [ ] Better 'for' loop syntax to include increment control
- [ ] Currently to concatenate string we use the same operator as addition which is the 'plus' word. However I would prefer it to be the '+' symbol so I'll have to work on that
- [ ] Add a 'dp-while' loop
